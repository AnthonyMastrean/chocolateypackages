    <summary>Getting to the content of a XCCDF formatted STIG to read and understand the content is not as easy as opening a .doc or .pdf file and reading it. This is a tool which can be used to view the STIGs</summary>
    <description>
The DoD/DISA STIG Viewer tool provides the capability to view one or more XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) formatted STIGs in an easy-to navigate, human-readable format. It is compatible with STIGs developed and published by DISA for the DoD. The purpose of the STIG Viewer is to provide an intuitive graphical user interface that allows ease of access to the STIG content, along with additional search and sort functionality unavailable with the current method of viewing the STIGs (using a style sheet in a web browser). 

STIG Viewer also supports additional functionality using the following features:

* Allows multiple STIGs to be imported and used when creating checklists. 
* Individually loads one or more XCCDF STIG files.
* Extracts XCCDF STIG files from zipped STIG packages.
* Creates a Local Data Cache on a system to store user configuration data and the current set of imported STIGs. This permits the reloading of the last set of loaded STIGs each time the STIG Viewer starts.
* Deletes the Local Data Cache from the Viewer’s options menu. STIG Viewer can only create one Local Data Cache at a time.
* Multiple XCCDF STIG files can be simultaneously unzipped and loaded from a .zip file containing one or more folders with zipped STIG packages. STIG Viewer will drill down to find all XCCDF files and load them. It then extracts all XCCDF files to its local folder since a Local Data Cache is required for this operation.
* Sorts the list of STIG requirements/vulnerabilities by Vulnerability ID, STIG ID, Rule ID, CCI, or Group/Rule Name.
* Searches or filters all loaded STIG files based on one or more keywords. Searches all fields or individual fields and then returns a filtered list of STIG requirements/vulnerabilities.
* Searches may also be restricted to Rule Title, STIG ID, Vulnerability ID, Rule ID, Severity, or CCI.
* Displays CCI data if the CCI reference is contained in the STIG requirements.
* Prints or exports (HTML and RTF file formats) selected STIG data for use with other programs (i.e., web browsers and Microsoft Word).
* Bases the printed/exported data on the list of requirements displayed in the center pane of the viewer and formats the output as a table containing each requirement. 
* Imports automated review SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) or XCCDF Results into the checklist, populating the checklist with the automated results. The manual portion of the review can be completed and added to the automated results.
* Exports the checklist as a .CSV file.
* NOTE: DISA initially developed STIG Viewer in Java and delivered it as a single JAR file for use with the Oracle Java 8 Java Runtime Environment (JRE). With changes in Java licensing and distribution accompanying the release of Java 11, DISA now provides a standalone STIG Viewer application in a ZIP file that does not require the Oracle JRE. This allows the application to run on 64-bit X86 systems running Windows, Linux, and macOS with minimal disruption to existing workflows. This limits the program to running at the permission level of the currently logged-in user.
* STIG Viewer does not open or use any network connections.
* Java creates Local Data Caches in the logged-in user’s local directory. This is a different location in each operating system.
* Under Windows 10, this is in the following directory: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\STIGV_AppData (When clearing the Local Data Cache, Java deletes the folder and the Local Data Cache simultaneously.)
* The input to the STIG Viewer is XCCDF contained in an XML file. STIG viewer rejects other file types. STIG Viewer is optimized for XCCDF-formatted STIGs produced by DISA for DoD
