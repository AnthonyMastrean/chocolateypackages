WiFi is awesome! ... but when something goes wrong, it can be a mystery to fix.

## Do you have the tools to solve the mystery?

There are a multitude of problems that could be impacting the WiFi and some basic network health questions you have to answer:

 * Do I have good WiFi coverage everywhere?
 * Am I on the best channel to avoid congestion?
 * What other devices are transmitting?
 * Are they interfering with my WiFi?

Because WiFi is invisible and everywhere, these questions are usually difficult to answer... unless you have the right tools to visualize your wireless environment.

## See Your WiFi with inSSIDer Lite

inSSIDer Lite is a WiFi troubleshooting and optimization tool that takes small WiFi network management to a whole new level. With a quick glance, you’ll be able to find poor channel placement, low signal strength, and RF interference in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.

Data provided by inSSIDer Lite will help you make educated decisions about access point placement and channel selection, so you can create a more reliable network without being a certified WiFi expert.
